## General Philosophy
The platform is designed with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness. Every interface, from authentication to settings, is easy to navigate, ensuring an intuitive experience for users. The design minimizes distractions, providing a clean interface that facilitates communication among fish enthusiasts.

## User Interface

### General Navigation & Main Feed
The main feed is designed for simplicity and ease of navigation. Posts are centered to focus attention, and users can easily interact by creating posts, searching hashtags, and visiting profiles. The interface ensures that all essential actions are accessible without cluttering the screen.

### User Profile
User profiles are designed for consistency and ease of use. They display user information and posts in a format similar to the main feed, with added options for content management. The profile page allows users to manage their own posts and navigate to settings seamlessly.

### Moderation Feed
The moderation interface is streamlined to allow moderators to efficiently manage reports without unnecessary information. Moderators can take actions such as removing posts or banning users, ensuring the platform remains a safe space for all.

## Database Design

### Overview
The database design is structured around key entities such as users, posts, conversations, and interests/hashtags. It includes comprehensive tables for moderation, user management, and content tracking. The design facilitates efficient data management and user interactions, with attention to data security and integrity.

## Module

### Overview
The platform's modules reflect the database structure, ensuring seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end. Each module is designed to handle specific functionalities, such as authentication, moderation, and content management.

### Database
The database module is the backbone, enabling access and manipulation of data across the platform. It serves as the foundation for other modules to interact with the underlying data.

### Authentication
The authentication module handles user data management, including registration, login, and profile updates. The interface is kept minimal to ensure a smooth user experience, with added security features such as password hashing and email validation.

### Moderation
The moderation module empowers a select group of users to maintain the platform's standards by managing reported content. It provides necessary tools for content removal and user management while ensuring that moderation power is not misused.

### Feed
The feed module is central to the user experience, allowing users to create, view, and interact with posts. It includes a post creation interface and an algorithm to personalize content based on user interests and activity.

### Conversations
The conversations module was partially implemented and intended to enable user communication. Although incomplete, the groundwork was laid for future development.

## History Of the Project
The project was developed over several weeks, with incremental progress across various modules. Initial efforts focused on database creation and core modules, followed by interface design and bug fixing. Challenges included implementing the conversation module and optimizing the feed algorithm.
